# Smart punching bag

It's a simple Arduino project that is about smart punching bags. In this project, we have some LEDs and buttons. Every LED has an equivalent button.
In each round, one random LED will light up and waits for the user to press the equivalent button. When the equivalent button is pressed, the elapsed time
will be calculated and printed in the output. One another parameter that the project will calculate is total elapsed time. This parameter sum up
all the elapsed time in passed rouneds.
